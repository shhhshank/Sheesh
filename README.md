# Sheesh Programming Language

## Overview

**Sheesh** is a dynamically-typed interpreted programming language designed for simplicity and ease of use. It supports basic data types such as numbers, strings, and lists, as well as control flow constructs like conditionals (`if` statements), loops (`for` and `while` loops), and function definitions.

## Data Types

### Number

- Basic numerical data type.

### String

- Represents sequences of characters.

### List

- Represents an ordered collection of values.

## Variables

- Variables are used to store and manage data.

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

- `+` (Addition)
- `-` (Subtraction)
- `*` (Multiplication)
- `/` (Division)
- `**` (Exponentiation)

### Comparison Operators

- `==` (Equal to)
- `!=` (Not equal to)
- `<` (Less than)
- `>` (Greater than)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)

### Logical Operators

- `AUR` (Logical AND)
- `AOO` (Logical OR)
- `NA` (Logical NOT)

## Control Flow

### Conditional Statements

### Loops

#### For Loop

#### While Loop

### Functions

- Functions are defined using `FUNC` keyword.

### Built-in Functions

- `PRINT`, `INPUT`, `LEN`, `APPEND`, `POP`, `EXTEND`, and more.

## Special Keywords

- `NULL`: Represents a null or undefined value.
- `TRUE` and `FALSE`: Boolean values.
- `MATH_PI`: Represents the mathematical constant Pi.

## Built-in Functions

### `PRINT(value)`

- Prints the given value to the console.
- Replace image here with a code displaying the `PRINT` function.

### `INPUT()`

- Reads a line of input from the user and returns it as a string.
- Replace image here with a code displaying the `INPUT` function.

### `APPEND(list, value)`

- Adds the specified value to the end of the given list.
- Replace image here with a code displaying the `APPEND` function.

### `LEN(list)`

- Returns the length of the given list.
- Replace image here with a code displaying the `LEN` function.

### `RUN(filename)`

- Executes the Sheesh script in the specified file.
- Replace image here with a code displaying the `RUN` function.

## Execution

- Execution starts from the `run` function, which takes a filename and the script text as arguments.

## Example Sheesh Script

- Replace image here with a code displaying an example Sheesh script.
